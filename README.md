![Lipan Cover](http://i.imgur.com/wJ7u3kW.png)

Lipan is a proof-of-concept web-based GUI whose focus is to offer network security professionals with a mdoern and scalable platform for conducting day-to-day penetration testing and network security tasks. Built upon the Django backend, Lipan's core strenght lies in its utilization of Django webapp structure to quickly permit the addition of new tool plugins developed by the community. In this sense, data generated by one tool can quickly be extracted from Lipan's database for follow-on processing in other tools. Lipan's persistent presence and support for user accounts also affords teams the ability to collaborate and strategize through built-in communication capabilites.

Interested in implementing new capabilities into Lipan? Feel free to join the community here on the tool's Github page to generate new forks for consideration into the master branch.

For questions on installation and implementaiton of the tool, please refer to Lipan's Wiki page here on Github: https://github.com/gaeran/lipan/wiki
